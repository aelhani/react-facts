JSX is a syntax similar to JS  
JSX produces React elements  
JSX alows us to define components  
JSX are expressions too (could be used inside JS)  
Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps  
React elements are plain objects  
React elements are immutable  
Components are custom complex React elements  
React separate concerns using Components  
React.createElement() create objects "React elements"  
React uses objects to construct/update the DOM  
Everything is converted to a string before render  
Babel is a JavaScript compiler  
Babel compiles JSX down to React.createElement() calls  
Babel can convert JSX syntax  
# PureComponent?  
# React Top-Level API?  
Components are like JavaScript functions  
Props are Read-Only  
Pure function return same results and don't change their inputs  
All React components must act like pure functions  
State is private and fully controlled by the component  
Do Not Modify State Directly  
# State Updates May Be Asynchronous?  
# What are Arrow Functions?  
Arrow funtions are useful for binding  
In React, The Data Flows Down (uni-directional)  
State can only affect components "below" in the tree  
# What are synthetic events in React?  
Keys help React identify which items have changed  
Keys serve as hint but they donâ€™t get passed to components  
# Formit for handling forms in React ?  
React recommands Composition over inheritance
In React, we Start With A Mock
